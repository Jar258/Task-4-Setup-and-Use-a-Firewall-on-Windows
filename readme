Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

Objective:
Configure basic firewall rules using Windows Firewall to block and allow specific network traffic.

Steps Performed:
1. Opened Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.
2. Created a new Inbound Rule to block TCP traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
3. Installed the Telnet client using the DISM command:
   dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
4. Tested the rule using Command Prompt:
   telnet localhost 23
   Result: "Could not open connection to the host" â€” confirmed port 23 is blocked.
5. Took a screenshot of the Telnet test and the firewall rule.
6. Removed the firewall rule to restore the system's original state.

Tools Used:
- Windows 10
- Windows Defender Firewall (GUI)
- Command Prompt (Admin)
- DISM command to install Telnet
- Telnet client for testing

Outcome
Successfully demonstrated how to create and test firewall rules on Windows.
Blocked Telnet (port 23), verified it was blocked, and then restored the system.
Blocked Telnet (port 22), verified it was blocked, and then restored the system.

Screenshots:

Included in the 'screenshots' folder:
- telnet-blocked.png (shows failed connection)
- firewall-rule.png (shows Inbound Rule for port 23)

conclusion:
This task provided hands-on experience with configuring Windows Firewall to manage network traffic. By creating rules to block Telnet (port 23) and verifying their effects using the Telnet client, I learned how to apply, test, and remove firewall rules effectively. The exercise reinforced key security concepts such as port-based filtering and the importance of blocking insecure protocols. This foundational skill is essential for protecting systems from unauthorized access and securing network communication.
